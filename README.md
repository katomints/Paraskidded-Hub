# Paraskidded-Hub
Originally Called "Paradise Hub"

Hello everyone, this is an open-source free script hub for the game called "Greenville", which the code was made entirely by ChatGPT, skidded, and in many other terms I couldn't have come up with yet.
The owner of "Paradise Hub" has decided to make a Script Hub community, which is currently on sale for real money or robux, if I can recall correctly. The owner uses alts in his server and bots to fill half of his server up and make the community look good, they wiped out general because they were getting blatantly exposed, I called them out and I wanted a fair talk. But, they've banned me. Which caused me to think, then eventually release this open-source hub onto GitHub, and many other communities to save people money and avoid getting them scammed.

Please, if you're gonna buy a script hub, MAKE sure they have a good reputation, and the features that will be useful. Use this with caution such as alts if you want to experiment, this code may be detectable in greenville and may get you banned.
